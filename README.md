# CSC-555
There might be a problem with the fx. Everytime I load the project it regenerates a block of code
that causes errors but deleteing that block seems to fix it. There will be 3 #if endif statements to delete
I just hit clear and double click on the error and delete the if and save. I think it has something to do with
the unity version i'm not sure.
